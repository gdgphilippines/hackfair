<h2>Claudine Rodriguez</h2>
<p>Claudine usually has her mind wandering, thinking about ideas on how to solve problems from the mundane to the ambitious. She ties those mental loose ends by making things through Apparently, a product development studio she cofounded. On weekdays, she works as a UI/UX designer for an ad agency in Makati. The rest of the time, youâ€™d probably find her reading, making coffee or just awkwardly singing.</p>
